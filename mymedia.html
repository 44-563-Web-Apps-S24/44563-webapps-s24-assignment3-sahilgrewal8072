      "You Can Win" by Shiv Khera is my favourite book, it is appreciated for
      its motivational and transformative influence. The book inspires me with
      practical insights, empowering me to foster a positive mindset, set goals,
      and overcome challenges. Khera's motivational approach, coupled with
      real-life anecdotes, makes the book a valuable guide for achieving
      personal and professional success.

      "Golmaal: Fun Unlimited" is one of tops of my list as a favorite film, thanks to its
      perfect mixture of fun comedy and a stellar cast led by Indian Actor Ajay Devgn
      and Mr. Arshad Warsi. Directed by Mr. Rohit Shetty, the movie's funny, clever and witty
      dialogues, coupled with humor, ensure a delightful cinematic
      experience. The lighthearted storyline, filled with amusing situations and
      witty banter, makes it my go-to choice for a laughter-filled break.
